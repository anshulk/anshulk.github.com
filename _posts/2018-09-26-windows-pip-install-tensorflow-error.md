Trying to install tensorflow on windows and getting this error on `pip install tensorflow` ?

```bash
Collecting tensorflow
Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tensorflow (from versions: )
No matching distribution found for tensorflow
```

**Check your python version!**

At time of writing this, tensorflow is available for python 3.4,3.5,3.6 but the latest python is 3.7 .

I had installed python 3.7 and got this error.
Uninstalling 3.7 and **installing 3.6 made it work**.
