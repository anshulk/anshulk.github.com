title: Reinventing wheels(APIs, Libraries) 
---


I love __coding__. 
To the extent that I love coding from _scratch_, from the *bottom*.

What I mean, is not using __ready-to-use__ and god-knows-how-it-works functions and features of a language. I really witnessed this to a huge extent when I started developing __mobile apps__. For a basic app, you just need to click some buttons and do some __drag and drop__, and its done. I was like _" Where's the coding ? "_. 

More precisely this will be called,
>__Reinventing The Wheel__

I personally love __thinking out__ the way to solve a problem, instead of just using a function. At least I wished to do that. But _I wonder if I really did so_. I'll talk in the context of **C**, the language I adore and code in.

* C does have "library functions" like printf, whose implementation I hardly knew when I started.
* Finding a perfect library function is a joy in itself and I use them quite enthusiastically.

So it seems I've already been using a __lots of wheels__. I guess unless I'm coding in Assembly, it's difficult to avoid wheels. The best part though is that the code behind the wheels is mostly available and it gives a satisfaction that I'm not using the function blindly.

The usual C has but small and few wheels to boast of. Modern languages and C too, now have _big, multipurpose and heavily armed wheels called libraries or APIs_.

These wheels are like gears of all sizes and types that fit together to _save you lots of typing_ at least if not thinking and brain-storming. 

* They help you use ready made functions that do most of your work.
* Coding shifts from thinking to reading API and Library documentation. 
* Large projects benefit largely as coding time and effort reduces . 

But I also feel that coders, specially beginners __loose the chance to think there way out of a problem__ and that __feeling of accompolishment__ that comes from coding a C program, but never comes from drag and drop for a mobile app. 

On the other hand, I believe its _foolishness_ to write the same code again and again or to use new code instead of a function for a trivial objective. Moreover, I'll never mind using a function if it was coded by me earlier. Using someone else's code seems _unethical_ even, to me.

>I wonder where you draw the line. 

I'm glad there are libraries like GLib and at the same time miss having to fight (think) my way out of a problem. 

Do you love using wheels ?
