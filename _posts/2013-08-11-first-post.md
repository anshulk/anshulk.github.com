Here is my first post. 

And its kind of cool how this thing works. Hope to find more about this whole thing and how it can me more and more personalized. The idea now is to make is to make a minimalist yet beautiful blog, reflecting my personality. 

So, I've been experimenting with jekyll for a time now and its quite cool. You just need to concentrate on writing wonderful plain text file posts and leave the work of presenting on your blog to jekyll. The best part is that jekyll doesn't take away any freedom from you. You still have full control of what is and how it is shown to the visitors. 

Its like defining the class for once in a object-oriented language and forming as many objects as you'd like from that class. You need now define anything again. 

So, its just an automation of making all your plain text articles into beautiful blog posts, taking the definition of beauty from you. 

Cheers.
