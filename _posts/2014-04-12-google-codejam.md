title: Google Code Jam Qualification round
---

Google's prestigious coding competition's qualification round went on-air about 20 hours ago.  

I gave it a shot and I'm glad I __solved 3 out of 4__ problems. This should be enough to qualify for the next round. Got __55 points__ out of 90.  

I'm _feeling great_.

Frankly, it seemed easier this year than previous years, may be because I'm more experienced now.  
Let me give you small overview of the problems which you can find on the [Code Jam site](http://code.google.com/codejam).

* __Magic Trick__  
This problem was quite easy, just required you to play with matrices.
* __Cookie Clicker Alpha__  
More logic and thinking was required in this one. But once you sort out that, code was minimum. 
* __Minesweeper Master__  
The problem is quite insteresting and I did try to figure out a way to solve this with pen and paper (the best way to decide your algo), I left it in favour of last problem.
* __Deceitful War__  
The hero of this round. The problem starts with a warning that its not for beginners. Sorting out this one was the most enjoyable part and pen-paper came in handy. I __highly recommend__ this problem to anyone who thinks he is a coder.

I can see that my coding style has evolved and I now use structs and functions more, leading to a  cleaner and more beautiful, elegant code. You can find my code [here](https://github.com/anshulk/code/tree/master/codejam).

Thanks for reading.
