title: Ubuntu 13.10 Scopy Salamander
---

I just got the latest Ubuntu, and figured out its all about **Scopes**!

Apart from that, _Saucy Salamander_ brings you
* New Wallpapers 
* Lots of updates
* Visual Tweaks
* Latest Kernel 
* Better Speeds

The problem is that most of this comes with all versions, so there's only one thing to be excited about.


####What are Scopes ?
Scopes are a way to refine the results you get in Ubuntu *dash*. 
With around 70 scopes now, Ubuntu tries to help you use the dash to get almost any thing you wish for. 

But does it ? 

The scopes or _Dash Plugins_ as Ubuntu like to call them are bizzare, with lots of unfamiliar names.

Some results can be interesting:

Some can be perfect:

And ya, right clicking reveals more:

After experimenting a little, I realize the scopes are heading in the right direction, its just that they're not quite there. 
Experimenting with the scopes is sort of fun, and it sure surprises. 

I guess I may need a seperate posts to dive in. 

Other changes include the volume drop down including "YouTube" along with Rhythmbox, a few new icons here and there and a new look for nautilus. 

Overall, if you wish to experiment and love being cutting edge, go for upgrading, else you can skip this one.
