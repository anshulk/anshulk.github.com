title: Tweaking your Nexus 4
---

###What do you mean ? 
Well by tweaking here, I mean unlocking, rooting and flashing your own recovery and ROM on your mako to unleash its full potential. 

###Steps involved:
The whole process can be divided into the following steps :
* Unlock your bootloader
* Flash a custom recovery 
* Flash a custom ROM 
* Root your phone 
* Flash a custom kernel 

####Unlocking

_Unlocking erases everything on your device you changed, be sure to have a backup._

Make sure you have an Android development environment set up on your computer. I mean you have the adt downloaded. I'm using Ubuntu, windows procedure is similar. 

* __Enable USB debugging on your phone.__ It's in "Developer options" in Settings. If you can't find it, go to "About Phone" and tap the "Build number" 7 times, you'll get toasts saying you're a developer now. Go back and enable it. 

* __Plug in to your computer.__ Accept when your phone prompts about enabling USB debugging. 

* __Get there.__ On a terminal, cd to the sdk/platform-tools directory in your adt. 

* __Reboot into bootloader what.__ When you're ready, take in a deep breath and in write in terminal :

	{% highlight sh %}
	sudo ./adb reboot bootloader
	{% endhighlight % }

	Your Nexus 4 should now boot into bootloader. You'll see "locked" at the bottom.

* __Unlock the bootloader.__ It's as simple as running :

	sudo ./fastboot oem unlock
