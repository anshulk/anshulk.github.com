title: Asus X200CA KX219D review - portable beast
---

I lost my previous laptop, a __Lenovo G580__ _(i5 3rd gen, 4 GB, 500 GB)_ in a tragic incident last month. 

So, for my next machine, I wanted to try something different, viz __portability__, without having to lose much on power and capacity.  

My _primary OS is linux_ and I _hardly shutdown_ my laptop. So I couldn't compromise on processing power leaving most of the portable netbooks out of the question. 

On the day I went to the showrooms, I saw a number of laptops, but fell in love with this one on the first encounter.

>__Very portable, light-weight, nicely built with spaced keys and a buttonless touchpad. All of this with i3, 4 GB, 500 GB.__ 
Considering the screen size of __11.6"__ only, this was a dream configuration. I couldn't see any more laptops.

I had to compromise with just two things viz __Screen Size__ and __DVD Drive__ while in return I got extreme portability and ease of use. 

It struck me that even if I buy a full sized laptop in near future, a portable i3 could be of great use. So I got it.  

Around 20 days later, I can say it was the right decision. I'm hugely satisfied and delighted by its performance and portability. 

Here are the _specifications_ :

* __Intel i3 3217U (3rd Gen)__
* __4 GB DDR3__
* __500 GB__ 
* __11.6 inches LCD__
* __1 x USB 3.0 + 2 x USB 2.0__

Features I _like_ the most :

* __Extremely light weight__: you can easily hold it with one hand
* __Sturdy build__: not delicate but quite rigid, even on the LCD.
* __Keyboard__: spacious keys make typing a delight.
* __Thin__: the laptop is quite thin specially on the front
* __Charger__: charger is mac inspired. Similar size and build, just black. 
* __Indicator LEDs__: 5 of them - power, battery, hdd, wi-fi and capslock.
* __Sound__: you won't expect such volume and quality initially.

Things I _wish were better_ :
* __Temperature__: just a little more than my last laptop. 
* __Arrow Keys__: can't blame the designers, just wish they were bigger.
* __Camera__: though I never use it, a HD camera will be appreciated.
* __Power Button__: could have been designed and placed better.

I'd _highly recommend_ this laptop to everyone. Specially those like me who use laptops a lot.

After using both a full sized and a small sized laptop, I can see with no doubt that using a laptop this small and light is a _delightful experience_ you'll cherish. 

Thanks for reading! Do comment!
