####the blog
*home sweet home*

This blog is hosted on [github][1] for free and served by [jekyll][2]. More on that soon.  
See the source code [here](http://github.com/anshulk/anshulk.github.com). Feel free to use, improve and reflect back. 

####the inspiration
I'd always wished to have a personal stage to speak my heart out, and this is it.

I have read some nice and minimalist blogs like [zen:habits](http://www.zenhabits.net) and sites like that of [Pranav Mistry](http://www.pranavmistry.com).
The simplicity yet impactability of the look is the inspiration behind what you see.  
Tell me your thoughts about minimalism.

####the vision
I've coded the things around here from scratch (served by [jekyll][2]) and decided to use just HTML5 and CSS3 as the ingredients.   
I'm keeping javascript apart to discover and unleash the power of CSS transforms. "*Just a personal adventure.*"  
Pour in your impressions.
